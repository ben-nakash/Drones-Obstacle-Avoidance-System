# Drones-Obstacle-Avoidance-System
This repository holds all my work for my final project in order to complete my bachelor degree in Software Engineering.

# Welcome to my Final Project wiki!

My final project takes place within a start-up company named 'Airscort'. At Airscort, we are a group of mechanical, software and electrical engineers that are passionate and excited about the future of drone technology. Until the recent years, drones technology have been used mainly for military needs. But now there's a huge increase in demand for drones in the private and commercial industries.
In 'Airscort' we're developing revolutionary applications for commercial drone technology. Our main focus is developing advanced systems which will prolong user experience. Our technology will enhance a wide range of civilian drone applications including: 
* Videography
* Entertainment
* Security
* Tourism
* Agriculture 
* 3D Mapping

My goal is to create a system that detects obstacles and avoid them in order to let the drone fly autonomously.
